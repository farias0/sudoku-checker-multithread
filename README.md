# Sudoku Multithreaded Validator
Check if a Sudoku solution is valid using Java threads

You should have a `sudoku_input.txt` file in your working directory 
(generally, where you are running the .jar from)
with the solution to be checked in the following format:

```
8 2 7 1 5 4 3 9 6
9 6 5 3 2 7 1 4 8
3 4 1 6 8 9 7 5 2
5 9 3 4 6 8 2 7 1
4 7 2 5 1 3 6 8 9
6 1 8 9 7 2 4 3 5
7 8 6 2 3 5 9 1 4
1 5 4 7 9 6 8 2 3
2 3 9 8 4 1 5 6 7
```

There's an example file included with the code. Feel free to reuse and modify it.
